            <h1 style="text-align:left;">About me</h1>

            <p style="text-align:left;"> 
                I'm a curious learner and adapt to change easily. I am able to learn well while working, and deliver expected results when expected. I don't like delays, and I am quite a perfectionist - I really love putting my best in whatever I am doing or assigned to do.
            </p>
			
            <p style="text-align:left;"> 
                I started learning to code while an undergraduate, though I had to leave it intermittently in order to face my studies squarely. Now that I'm really interested in developing my self, I've resolved to be committed to learning and consistent in the learning path before me.
            </p>

			<h1 style="text-align:left;">Qualifications & Skills</h1>

            <p style="text-align:left;"> 
                I am able to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I would say that I have an intermediate skills level in front end web development. Besides my technical skills, one othere qualification that makes me stand out is my ability to learn fast, and ask questions when in doubt - I don't pretend to know it all.
            </p>
			
            <p style="text-align:left;">
                I'm a graduate of the University of Lagos. I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering, and finished with a Second Class Upper Honors degree. Going through the university, I developed ability to think for myself, and solve problems around me and those of others. <br>
                Those days of learning helped improve my analytical skills as well as my communication skills. I am able to work well in a team, and relate well with my superiors or instructors.
            </p>
