                I started my internship with Manifest & Company officially today. Being the first day of work, I started with the basics - working mostly with HTML files.<br>
                The CSS templates using Bootstrap and Javascript files were given in the resources for learning today.
                I learnt how to properly organise my files in specific folders.<br>
                Basically, I had folders for each of the different file types: HTML, CSS, Javascript and images.
                Properly organising the files in folders enables easy location and referencing, especially when including them in anchor tag href attribute, image source links, javascript source attribute as well as CSS href attribute.<br>
                The webpage I worked with today consists of five pages: Home, About Me, Portfolio, My Diary and Contact. I learnt how to link the pages to each other, and set a current page being viewed as "active". <br>
                Finally, I learnt how to freely host my project using <a href="https://github.io" target = "_blank" style="color: rgb(226, 104, 104);">Github's free hosting service.</a><br>
                The task I have for myself after completing the day's work is to visit bootstrap's site and learn how to use the bootstrap css contents in my webpage when and where I need them.

            Everyday, the training gets more interesting. For the first time in my web dev learning process,
            I used AWS platform or IDE. I worked in a shared environment on Cloud9 IDE.
            <br> I also learnt to code remotely into GitHub. In some of the previous lessons I have taken before, I learnt some basic git commands.
            For example, from a github course I took on EdX, I learnt all the commands I used today - the only difference is that I used my windows terminal or command prompt to execute the commands.
            I also learnt to push and pull updates using windows command prompt when working on projects typed in a local text editor like visual studio code (my favourite).
            <br>At the end of today's lesson, I opened a new branch called <em>develop</em> where I staged the changes made for today.
